# Market-Research

Analysis goal: Market research on restaurants in LA.
Opening a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles is promising but expensive project. The investors are interested in the current market conditions and whether the project will be able to maintain success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off.

To sum up our findings:

1. The overwhelming majority of the establishments in Los Angeles are restaurants, followed by Fast Food (11%) and Cafes (5%);
